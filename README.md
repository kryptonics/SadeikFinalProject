# SadeikFinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270

For my final project for Data Structures, I am writing an encryption algorithm called crypto that will run as a command line program. it will take either a typed message or a text file as input and spit out a encrypted version of the text in the command line or as a text file. it will also take an encrypted text file and a corresponding encryption key as input and decrypt the message assuming that the key is correct. The methods it wil use to encrypt the text work much like shuffling a deck of cards. These methods will be employed in random order, a random number of times with the order of ops and the number of time each operation is done being recorded in the encryption key as integers. In addition, the same set of methods will be applied to a pool of random symbols recording the order and number times each operation is performed in the key. Then, first however many unique groups of 3 symbols will be taken and assigned to represet all the symbols of a standard keyboard. This will be used to convert the letters of the now scrambled message into a gibberish consisting of completely randomized symbols. Decryption will work by reading in an encrypted text file and manuallly entering its key in the command line. if the key is correct, then all the encrypting operations wil be performed in reverse resulting in the original message.
